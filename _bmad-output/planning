3. **Scope Creep:** Dispute letter templates (US-20) may require more complexity than anticipated.
4. **Payment Integration:** US-35 requires PCI compliance and security review.

---

## Success Criteria per Sprint

**Sprint 1:** Users can register, login, upload credit reports, and track processing status.

**Sprint 2:** Users see extracted tradelines with confidence scores, can review low-confidence items, and data is normalized.

**Sprint 3:** Users can generate dispute packets, upload required documents, and receive notifications.

**Sprint 4:** Users can track dispute status, admins have monitoring tools, paid fulfillment works end-to-end.

**Sprint 5:** Developers have testing tools, regression tests run automatically, documentation is complete.

## Annotation Guidelines

### Field Annotation Best Practices
1. **Consistent Labeling**
   - Use exact entity names defined above
   - Annotate all instances of each entity type
   - Include partial matches and variations

2. **Boundary Selection**
   - Include full dollar amounts with $ symbol
   - Include complete dates
   - Exclude punctuation unless part of the value

3. **Quality Standards**
   - Double-check all currency amounts
   - Verify account numbers are correctly masked/unmasked
   - Ensure creditor names are complete

### Common Annotation Challenges
- **Multi-line Fields**: When information spans multiple lines
- **Table Structures**: Fields in columns vs. rows
- **OCR Errors**: Handling corrupted text in training data
- **Duplicates**: Same tradeline appearing multiple times

## Training Process

### Phase 1: Initial Training (Week 1-2)
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather 15-25 diverse credit reports
   - Ensure representation from all major bureaus
   - Include various layouts and formats

2. **Annotation**
   - Use Document AI annotation tool
   - Follow annotation guidelines strictly
   - Complete quality review of all annotations

3. **Initial Model Training**
   - Upload annotated data to Document AI
   - Configure entity types and definitions
   - Start initial training run

### Phase 2: Evaluation & Refinement (Week 3)
1. **Model Evaluation**
   - Test on validation set
   - Analyze precision/recall for each entity
   - Identify problem areas

2. **Data Augmentation**
   - Add more training examples for poor-performing entities
   - Include edge cases and difficult formats
   - Re-annotate ambiguous examples

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Optimize for precision vs. recall balance
   - Fine-tune entity boundaries

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Week 4)

   - Mitigation: Phased approach with early validation
   - Backup: Deploy incremental improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
   - Begin collecting diverse credit report samples
   - Set up Document AI custom processor project
   - Define annotation schema and guidelines

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Complete annotation of training dataset
   - Begin initial model training
   - Set up evaluation framework

3. **Medium Term (Month 1)**

   - Implement monitoring and feedback systems
   - Document lessons learned and best practices

## Conclusion

Training a custom Document AI processor represents the highest-impact approach to solving the credit_limit and monthly_payment extraction accuracy issues. With proper execution, this project should deliver 85-95% field extraction accuracy, dramatically reducing manual review requirements and improving overall system reliability.

The investment of $200-500 and 4 weeks of effort will provide long-term value through significantly improved extraction accuracy and reduced operational overhead.

   doing in the process.

● Credit Clarity PDF OCR Workflow for Tradeline Extraction

  Overview

  The workflow processes credit report PDFs to extract tradeline information using multiple extraction methods with fallback strategies,
  chunking for large files, and caching for performance.

  Core Components and Flow

  1. Entry Point: API Router

  File: /backend/api/v1/routes/processing.py
  - Function: process_credit_report()
  - Purpose: Main endpoint that receives PDF uploads
  - Key Operations:
    - Validates PDF format and user authentication
    - Assigns A/B test variants
    - Routes based on file size (3MB threshold)
    - Calls either _process_synchronously() or _process_in_background()

  2. Routing Logic

  File: /backend/api/v1/routes/processing.py
  - Small files (<3MB): _process_synchronously() - immediate processing
  - Large files (>3MB): _process_in_background() - queued processing
  - Functions:
    - _process_synchronously(): Direct processing with instant response
    - _process_in_background(): Submits to background job queue

  3. Core Processing Engine

  File: /backend/services/optimized_processor.py
  - Main Function: process_credit_report_optimized()
  - Key Operations:
    a. Cache Check: Generates MD5 hash key, checks cache first
    b. Chunking Decision: _should_chunk_pdf() - checks if file needs chunking (>3MB or >30 pages)
    c. Processing Route:
        - Small files: _concurrent_extraction()
      - Large files: _process_with_chunking()

  4. PDF Chunking System (for large files)

  File: /backend/services/optimized_processor.py
  - Function: _process_with_chunking()
  - Process:
    a. Chunking: Uses PDFChunker to split PDF into 20-page chunks
    b. Parallel Processing: _process_single_chunk() for each chunk concurrently
    c. Result Combination: Merges results from all chunks
    d. Deduplication: _deduplicate_tradelines() removes duplicates across chunks
    e. Cleanup: Removes temporary chunk files

  File: /backend/services/pdf_chunker.py
  - Class: PDFChunker
  - Function: chunk_pdf() - splits PDFs into smaller files using PyPDF2

  5. Concurrent Extraction Methods

  File: /backend/services/optimized_processor.py
  - Function: _concurrent_extraction()
  - Strategy: Runs multiple extraction methods in parallel, returns first successful result
  - Methods Available:
    a. PDFPlumber: _extract_with_pdfplumber_async()
        - Best for structured text and tables
      - Processes in 10-page chunks for memory management
    b. PyMuPDF: _extract_with_pymupdf_async()
        - Good for complex layouts
      - Limited to first 50 pages for performance
    c. OCR (Tesseract): _extract_with_ocr_async()
        - Fallback for scanned documents
      - Only for files <10MB, processes first 3 pages

  6. Text and Table Parsing

  File: /backend/services/optimized_processor.py
  - Function: _concurrent_parsing()
  - Parallel Operations:
    a. Table Parsing: _parse_tables_async() → _extract_tradelines_from_table()
    b. Text Parsing: _parse_text_with_gemini_async() → calls main.py's GeminiProcessor

  7. Tradeline Extraction from Tables

  File: /backend/services/optimized_processor.py
  - Function: _extract_tradelines_from_table()
  - Process:
    a. Header Mapping: Maps column headers to standard tradeline fields
    b. Row Processing: Converts table rows to tradeline dictionaries
    c. Null Safety: Handles None values and empty cells
    d. Validation: Only includes tradelines with creditor name and account number

  8. Gemini AI Text Processing

  File: /backend/main.py
  - Class: GeminiProcessor
  - Function: extract_tradelines()
  - Purpose: Uses Google Gemini AI to parse unstructured text for tradeline data
  - Fallback: When table extraction doesn't yield enough results

  9. Database Integration

  File: /backend/services/database_optimizer.py
  - Function: batch_insert_tradelines()
  - Process:
    a. Normalization: Uses utils/tradeline_normalizer.py
    b. Batch Insert: Efficiently inserts multiple tradelines
    c. Duplicate Prevention: Checks existing tradelines by creditor + account number
    d. Error Handling: Continues processing even if some inserts fail

  10. Background Job Processing

  File: /backend/services/background_jobs.py
  - Functions:
    - submit_pdf_processing_job(): Queues large file processing
    - process_pdf_job(): Worker function that calls the optimized processor
  - Features:
    - Job queuing with priorities (low/normal/high)
    - Progress tracking and status updates
    - Extended timeouts (up to 10 minutes)

  11. Performance Optimizations

  Memory Management

  - Class: MemoryManager in optimized_processor.py
  - Functions: Memory usage monitoring, temp file cleanup

  Caching

  - Class: ProcessingCache in optimized_processor.py
  - Strategy: MD5-based caching with TTL (1 hour)

  Timeouts

  - Dynamic Timeouts: Base 60s + 10s per MB, max 600s (10 minutes)
  - File Size Routing: 3MB threshold for background processing

  Workflow Summary

  1. PDF Upload → API Router (processing.py)
  2. File Size Check → Route to Sync/Background
  3. Optimized Processor → Cache check
  4. Chunking Decision → Split if large (>3MB/>30 pages)
  5. Concurrent Extraction → PDFPlumber + PyMuPDF + OCR
  6. Parallel Parsing → Tables + Gemini AI text parsing
  7. Deduplication → Remove duplicate tradelines
  8. Database Save → Batch insert with normalization
  9. Response → Return tradelines + metadata

  The system is designed for reliability (multiple extraction methods), performance (caching, chunking, concurrency), and scalability
  (background jobs, memory management).

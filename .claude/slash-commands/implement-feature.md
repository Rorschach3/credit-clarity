**Autonomous Feature Implementation Workflow**

This command triggers a complete autonomous feature implementation using the project-coordinator agent to orchestrate specialized agents.

## Usage
```
/implement-feature "feature description"
```

## Process
1. **Project Analysis** (project-coordinator):
   - Parse feature requirements and scope
   - Break down into backend, frontend, testing, and deployment tasks
   - Create comprehensive implementation plan with milestones
   - Identify dependencies and optimal execution sequence

2. **Backend Implementation** (backend-architect):
   - Design and implement API endpoints
   - Create database models and migrations
   - Add authentication and validation
   - Implement business logic and error handling
   - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests

3. **Frontend Implementation** (frontend-specialist):
   - Design and implement UI components
   - Create responsive layouts and interactions
   - Integrate with backend APIs
   - Add error handling and loading states
   - Implement accessibility features

4. **Quality Assurance** (qa-automation):
   - Create end-to-end test scenarios
   - Implement automated testing suite
   - Perform security and performance testing
   - Validate user experience and accessibility
   - Generate comprehensive test reports

5. **Deployment & Operations** (devops-orchestrator):
   - Update deployment configurations
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Create deployment pipeline updates
   - Ensure production readiness
   - Document operational procedures

6. **Integration & Validation** (project-coordinator):
   - Coordinate final integration testing
   - Validate feature completion against requirements
   - Generate implementation documentation
   - Provide deployment instructions and rollback procedures

## Extended Thinking Trigger
```
Think deeply about the complete implementation strategy for this feature, considering:
- Technical architecture and design patterns
- User experience and interface design
- Security and performance implications
- Testing strategies and quality assurance
- Deployment and operational considerations
- Future maintenance and scalability
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete backend API implementation
- Responsive frontend interface
- Comprehensive test suite
- Deployment configurations
- Documentation and operational guides
- Performance and security validation

## Success Criteria
- All acceptance criteria met
- 95%+ test coverage achieved
- Performance benchmarks satisfied
- Security validation passed
- Documentation complete
- Production deployment ready

Start implementation by analyzing requirements and creating detailed execution plan.

### ‚úÖ Authorization Security

1. **User Authorization**
   - [x] User can only access their own data

   - [x] Role-based access control (admin detection)
   - [x] Proper error messages (no information leakage)

2. **Endpoint Protection**
   - [x] All sensitive endpoints require authentication
   - [x] Authentication bypasses removed from production code
   - [x] Proper dependency injection for authentication

### ‚úÖ Configuration Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
   - [x] Environment variables properly configured
   - [x] Fallback values for development only

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - [x] CORS origins properly configured
   - [x] Credentials handling enabled
   - [x] Headers properly exposed

### ‚úÖ Error Handling Security

1. **Error Messages**
   - [x] No sensitive information in error messages
   - [x] Generic error messages for authentication failures
   - [x] Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 500)

2. **Logging Security**
   - [x] Authentication attempts logged
   - [x] No sensitive data in logs
   - [x] Failed authentication attempts tracked

### ‚úÖ Performance Security

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - [x] Rate limiting implemented
   - [x] Configurable request limits
   - [x] Time window configuration

2. **Caching**
   - [x] JWKS data properly cached
   - [x] Cache invalidation after timeout
   - [x] Memory usage considerations

## Security Tests Results

### Backend Tests (test_jwks_auth.py)
```
‚úÖ PASS - Environment Configuration: All required environment variables set
‚úÖ PASS - JWKS Endpoint Accessibility: Endpoint accessible with 1 keys
‚úÖ PASS - JWKS Data Structure: Valid structure with 1 keys
‚úÖ PASS - JWKS Caching: Cache working (first: 0.000s, second: 0.000s)
‚úÖ PASS - Invalid Token Handling: All invalid tokens properly rejected
‚úÖ PASS - Key Lookup: Key lookup working correctly
Overall: 6/6 tests passed
```

### Frontend Tests (jwks-test.ts)
- Environment variable configuration
- JWKS endpoint accessibility
- Token retrieval and validation
- Authentication flow testing
- Error handling validation

## Security Recommendations

### üîí Production Security

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use production-grade environment variable management
   - Implement secret rotation procedures
   - Monitor for exposed secrets in logs

2. **Network Security**
   - Ensure HTTPS-only communication
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider VPN for backend services

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement authentication monitoring
   - Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor JWKS endpoint availability

### üö® Security Warnings

1. **Development Mode**
   - Some authentication is relaxed in development
   - Ensure development flags are disabled in production
   - Test authentication in production-like environment

2. **Token Storage**
   - Implement secure token storage on client side
   - Consider token refresh mechanisms
   - Implement proper session management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Never expose internal error details
   - Log errors securely for debugging
   - Implement proper error monitoring

## Security Incident Response

### üî¥ High Priority Issues

1. **Token Compromise**
   - Revoke compromised tokens immediately
   - Force user re-authentication
   - Investigate scope of compromise

2. **JWKS Endpoint Compromise**
   - Contact Supabase support immediately
   - Implement emergency authentication bypass
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

3. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Disable affected endpoints
   - Implement emergency patches
   - Conduct security audit

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

1. **Rate Limiting Bypass**
   - Adjust rate limiting parameters
   - Implement additional IP-based restrictions
   - Monitor for abuse patterns

2. **Cache Poisoning**
   - Clear JWKS cache immediately
   - Implement cache validation
   - Monitor for suspicious requests

## Compliance and Audit

### üìã Audit Trail

1. **Authentication Events**
   - All authentication attempts logged
   - User access patterns recorded
   - Failed authentication attempts tracked

2. **Configuration Changes**
